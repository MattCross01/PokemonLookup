# Project 2 - Pokemon Lookup (Database)

MIT<br>[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

* Pokemon lookup uses an API for a search and database for pokemon
* A user can create a profile and save favorite pokemon for a quick reference

* [Live Application Demo](https://thepokemonproject.herokuapp.com/)

## Overview

This application uses Express, handlebars, Model-View-Controller & MySQL.
The sample app is deployed using heroku.

## Workload Breakdown

* Matt Cross: MySQL Server 
* Nester Campaner: API/Controllers
* Cam Rushing: Handlebars/CSS Frontend
* Winston Nieradka: API/Public JS

## Strategy

Our goal was to follow server and routing structure setups featured in in-class activities. The boilerplate server.js file works well for this application, as well as some previous material for writing files.

## Challenges

For challenges, i would have to say getting the API and HTML routes were quite the challenge to get it working properly through the localhost. Although the application deployed successfully through Heroku, it is still required to get the application to run properly in a local setting.
